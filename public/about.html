<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Do I really have to write stuff in this? Fine. I'm Nicolas Hinds, I was born on April 27th of 2009.
  I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, but all of that changed when my parents divorced. 
  I was practically sent unconsensually (out of my will) to Dominican Republic (where I do not enjoy it so much).
  Yeah I was a child, so what?
</p>

<p>So I've been like living here for a few years now and I'm not gonna lie it's so lame.
  The schools here suck, the people here suck, the government here suck, even the language is sucky.
  I just can't wait to go back to live in the United States. 
  But while I am over here, I go to a school called Cathedral International School.
  It's a private school that's bilingual (because otherwise I would be cooked)
  and like I have a few friends but so what.
</p>

<p>I swear I really try my hardest in school. My mom is pushing me to do some research about my future though.
  That's why I told her to buy me this. When I saw the price, it was at $15. 
  But she didn't press the discount button and so she paid the whole 70 so dollars for it.
  Yeah that's pretty much it, bye.
